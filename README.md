# mastering-sk-book-code

This repository contains the source code for the book **Mastering Semantic Kernel**, published by Manning. The code samples are provided to help readers follow along with the book and experiment with the examples in both C# and Python.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by chapter. For each chapter, there are subdirectories for both C# (`csharp/`) and Python (`python/`) implementations:

```
src/
  chapters/
    chapter-01/
      csharp/
      python/
    chapter-02/
      csharp/
      python/
    ...
```

- Each `csharp/` folder contains the C# source code, project files, and dependencies for that chapter's examples.
- Each `python/` folder contains the Python scripts and requirements for the same examples.

This structure allows you to easily locate and run the code relevant to each chapter and language as you progress through the book.

Each project, when run, provides a menu that allows you to pick and execute a specific example from the chapter, making it easy to explore and test individual features or concepts.
